Disease Prediction 
As we witness the Health Care industry they have been Digitally transformed, life scientists and doctors have an ocean of data to base their research upon and Additionally huge volumes of health-related information are made accessible through many widely spread adoption of wearable tech. This opens up new opportunities for better, more informed healthcare. We are able to collect, structure and process a high volume of data and further make sense of it, to gain a much more deeper understanding of the human body its key objectives.it also has the strongest potential to revolutionize healthcare. This Data can be leveraged and used for a great transformation in Health care –  
As we see the Health care especially over the  PHC- level where the Government PHC’s (Primary health care centres) are structured in a way that a lot of people below poverty line and Low income and  economic level visit the PHC for their diagnose and health check-up but due to 1.Lack of Availability of Doctors  2.Unavailability of Doctors on times of patient need 3.Lack of knowledge of  environmental conditions 4. No proper efficient Diagnose for certain Diseases. To bridge this gap, we are bringing DISEASETAP - Disease prediction and Diagnose Automation through using Data Science and Machine learning where, we build Huge Datasets which include patient Lipid profiles and Blood test samples reports etc. we build Different Models for each disease and run a prediction analysis over these datasets with Careful and Prior knowledge over the parameters prescribed by the doctors in Diagnosing these diseases and then they are inculcated into our Programming interfaces, made into a running Prediction Models and Classifiers which will intern predict the disease the patient is effected with and also his Risk Factor
